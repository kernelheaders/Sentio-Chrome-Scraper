## Logo Source

The original logo is stored as `logo.png` and should be used to generate the various icon sizes.

## Generating Icons

To generate the required icon sizes from the logo:

1. Use an image editing tool (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
2. Resize `logo.png` to each required size
3. Ensure the logo remains centered and clear at small sizes
4. Save as PNG with transparency

## Notes

- Chrome extensions require square icons
- Icons should have transparent backgrounds
- High resolution (128px) used for Chrome Web Store listing
- Smaller icons (16px, 32px) should remain legible and recognizable
